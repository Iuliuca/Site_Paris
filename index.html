    <h1 class="title">On my way to Paris</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="text">It was Friday afternoon, when my parents and I arrived at Timișoara. I was very nervous, because I had never been on a plane
         before.  Of course, I was excited, but I was also scared. What if I loose my parents in the airport, or what if we
         got on the wrong plane?</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="text">Soon, all my fears were gone, and I gave way to happiness and excitment. After we took off, the staff came, they gave us 
         a bottle of water and a tiny biscuit, which was very tasty, by the way :). It took about 2h to get to Munich, and then we had to wait
        for about 1h 30 mins to get to the next plane, that wolud take us to Paris. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="text"> We arrived in Paris, at about 1:00 AM, and then we took an Uber, a Mercedes. The airport in Paris
        is HUGE. It was like a city, but for Planes! But it's not as beautiful (from the inside) as the Munich airport. 
        The airport in Munich is very big, and VERY modern, lots and lots of food :).</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px;" class="text"> The next morning, we woke up at 9:00 AM, and then we went out to buy some food, and we 
        bought a delicious chicken sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. </p>
